# Netflix_Skeleton
C++ implementation of a CLL and a DLL to create a movie slider skeleton akin to Netflix's movie selection process.

The code is a single file, originally split up into a header file followed by the cpp file for implementation. However, I shortened it to one file
for better space allocation on my local machine. The code still runs properly to showcase this DLL & CLL relationship in action. Enjoy!
